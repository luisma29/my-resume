                <h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
                    <p>
                    Sir Christopher Nolan strikes again! This time, he is bringing the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer to the big screen.
                    This is a 3-hour masterpiece that really gives you a fly-on-the-wall perspective of the Manhattan project and the story of those who made the project possible. 
                    This is a movie for real film buffs and deep thinkers. In my opinion, Sir Christopher Nolan has outdone himself and this has to be his best work to date.

                <h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>
                    <p>
                    You know how almost every action movie review says:<br />
                    <h4>"Get ready for edge-of-your-seat action!"</h4>
                    when it's pretty much a lie? Well, Top Gun Maverick will LITERALLY have you on the edge of your seat!!!
                    The graphics, the acting, the plot just make this movie so enjoyable...<br />
                    I was just as excited watching it the second time around as I was when I first saw it in the movie theater!

                <h3>All Quiet on the Western Front</h3>
                    <p>
                    The First World War as seen from the perspective of a young German soldier on the Western Front. 
                    This movie really stood out to me from all other war films I've seen given that it follows the story of the opposition, the Germans. 
                    It is a gripping story based on the novel by the same name and it is amazing! It really makes you feel for the young men that are sent to war
                    even before they're even old enough to drink...
